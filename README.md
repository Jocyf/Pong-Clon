Pong notes:
-----------

Font used: "6809 chargen": https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/typodermic/6809-chargen  

This project only use one sprite and 2d physics.


Project code notes:
-------------------

This project uses only one scene to show the Main menu and to play, activating/deactivating things properly.

Managers.

PongManager -> StartGame, PauseGame, Detect GameOver. Manage player & enemy scores and update this values on screen UI.

SkillManager -> Change the ball  and enemy paddle velocity movement each time you get points.


Al the oher code paddle movement, AI, ball movement, etc it's almost self explanatory.

There are several videos explaining all the process there are long videos (all in Spanish)

These videos are Youtuve_Life content, so I'm not only talking about this project, but there is an step by step part en each one that you can follow.
